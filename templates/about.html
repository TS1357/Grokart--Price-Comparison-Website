      Grokart is a website that uses webscraping code written in Python
      to compare the prices of grocery products across the India's leading
      e-supermarkets as well as local stores.

      To use the webscraper the SuperUser creates the product and gives it a
      Category and Name. In this same section the URL for each supermarket
      is then entered and stored into the database. Once the load-prices.py file
      is ran it will go through each URL in the database and scrape the prices
      from each webpage. Erroneous URLs/prices will be flagged in the terminal
      to the user.

      As of November 2022 this webscraper currently works for Amazon, Dmart and Local Store.
